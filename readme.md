# Codeforces Problem Solving ðŸ“š

This repository contains my solutions for **Codeforces problems** and **weekly contests**. It is aimed at improving problem-solving skills in algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming strategies.

## Features
- Solutions for Div. 2 and Div. 3 contests
- Organized by contest and problem rating
- Well-commented code for learning purposes
- Topics include: Implementation, Math, Greedy, Graphs, DP, Sorting, Two Pointers, and more

## Purpose
- Track my progress in competitive programming
- Share solutions for learning and reference
- Practice regularly to improve speed and accuracy

## Technologies
- C++
- Python (optional, if you solve some in Python)
- STL (for C++)
- Git & GitHub for version control

Feel free to explore, learn, or contribute! ðŸš€
